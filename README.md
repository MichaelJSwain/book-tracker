# Book Tracker
Inspired by Goodreads, Book Tracker is a simple React + TypeScript application that allows users to keep track of the books theyâ€™ve read, are currently reading, or plan to read. This project is part of my ongoing effort to develop engineering skills and best practices through a proactive, project-based approach to learning.

## Features
Add, edit, and delete books with title, author, and status

Organize books by reading status: To Read, Reading, Completed

Responsive, accessible UI built with React and TypeScript

Continuous Integration and Deployment using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages

Code linting, formatting, and testing integrated into CI workflow
